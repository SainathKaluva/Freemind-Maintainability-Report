If you create any custom metric, set, or rule procedures 
(see Section <a href="../manual/ExtendME.html">"Extending the Metrics and Rule engine"</a>
of the user manual), put your class files into this folder so SDMetrics
will find them. As per Java conventions, the class file for class <tt>com.acme.MyMetricProcedure</tt>
must be accessable under the path com/acme/MyMetricProcedure.class relative to this directory.
