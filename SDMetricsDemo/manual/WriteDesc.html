<h2><a name="WriteDesc"></a>8.6 Writing Descriptions</h2>


The measurement catalog (see <a href="MetCat.html">Section&nbsp;4.13 "The View 'Catalog'"</a>) provides detailed
descriptions of the design metrics, rules, and relation matrices,
complete with literature references and a glossary. These descriptions
are provided by the definitions in the metric definition file.<p>

Below is an example of a full-fledged metric description. Descriptions
of rules and matrices follow the exact same scheme.

<pre>
&lt;metric name="DIT" domain="class"&gt;
&lt;description&gt;The depth of the class in the inheritance tree.((p))
This is calculated as the longest glossary://Path/path/ from the class to
the root of the inheritance tree. The DIT for a class that has no
parents is 0.((p))
((ul))
((li))Defined in ref://CK94/.
((li))See also metric://class/CLD/.
((/ul))
&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;projection relation="genchild" target="generalization" element="genparent" 
 eltype="class" nesting="true"/&gt;
&lt;/metric&gt;

&lt;reference tag="CK94"&gt;S. Chidamber, C. Kemerer, "A Metrics Suite
  For Object Oriented Design", IEEE Trans. Software Eng., vol. 20, no. 6, 
  pp. 476-493, 1994.
&lt;/reference&gt;

&lt;term name="Path"&gt;A sequence of adjacent nodes in a graph. The
  sequence of nodes n(1), n(2), ..., n(m) is a path if there is an
  edge from n(i) to n(i+1) for all i from 1 to m-1.
&lt;term&gt;
</pre>

Below we explain the various features available for writing
descriptions.<p>

<b>HTML markup</b><p>

The detailed description is meant to be rendered in HTML. Therefore,
you can use HTML markups to format your text. However, because the
description is embedded in an XML file, you cannot use the plain HTML
tags. They would interfere with the XML structure. Instead of
enclosing your HTML tags with the usual &lt; and &gt; brackets, use
two subsequent opening and closing parentheses, like so: <code>Text in
((i))italics((/i)) or ((b))boldface((/b))</code>.<p>

The example for metric DIT above uses paragraphs and bulleted lists to
format the text.<p>

<b>Brief description and full description</b><p>

The first sentence of the description should be a short definition
that states the basic idea what the metric (or rule or matrix) is about.
It should be brief enough to fit in a single line (about 80
characters, but that is no hard limit).<p>

This first sentence must be terminated by a period, and must not use
any HTML markup. The brief descriptions are used in various windows of
SDMetrics' GUI, to provide short explanations of metrics, rules, and
matrices. The description then continues with additional explanations,
and notes about the metric. Together with the brief description, this
constitutes the full description shown in the measurement catalog.<p>

<b>Cross-references</b><p>

You can reference other metrics, rules, or matrices in the
description.

<ul>

<li>To cross-reference a metric, use a "metric locator" of the form
<code>metric://&lt;domain&gt;/&lt;name&gt;/</code>. For example, to
cross-reference a metric <code>NumOps</code> for elements of type
<code>class</code>, write <code>metric://class/NumOps/</code>. Note
the terminating slash at the end of the locator.

<li>Likewise, to cross-reference a rule, use a locator of the form
<code>rule://&lt;domain&gt;/&lt;name&gt;/</code>. For example, rule
<code>CyclicInheritance</code> for classes is referenced by
<code>rule://class/CyclicInheritance/</code>.

<li>To cross-reference a relation matrix, use a locator of the form
<code>matrix://&lt;matrix&gt;/</code>. A matrix named "Associations"
would be referenced by <code>matrix://Associations/</code>.</ul>

In the measurement catalog display, the locator will be replaced by an
HTML hyperlink that takes the user to the specified target.<p>

<b>Literature references</b><p>

To provide literature references, you define a bibliographic citation
as in the above example for metric DIT. The citation is enclosed in a
<code>reference</code> XML element. The element has one required
attribute, <code>tag</code>, which provides a handle for the
citation.<p>

You can then reference the citation in your metric, rule, and matrix
descriptions with a locator of the form
<code>ref://&lt;reference_tag&gt;/</code>, for example
<code>((li))Suggested in ref://CK94/.((/li))</code>. In the
measurement catalog display, the locator will be replaced by a
hyperlink that takes the user to the bibliographic citation of the
specified reference.<p>

<b>Glossary terms</b><p>

If your description uses any terms that you feel need additional
explanation, you can define these terms in a glossary. The above
example for metric DIT shows a definition for the term "Path".<p>

The term definition is enclosed in a <code>term</code> XML
element. The element has one required attribute, <code>name</code>,
which is the term that is defined. You can then use the term in your
description with a locator as follows:

<pre>glossary://&lt;Name&nbsp;of&nbsp;term&gt;/&lt;hyperlink&nbsp;text&gt;/</pre>

In the full description as shown to the user, the locator will be
replaced by a hyperlink that takes the user to the definition of the
term. If the name of the glossary term and the hyperlinked text to be
shown are identical, you can leave the hyperlinked text empty, like
so: <code>This is a glossary://WFR// of the UML</code> (note the two
slashes after "WFR").
