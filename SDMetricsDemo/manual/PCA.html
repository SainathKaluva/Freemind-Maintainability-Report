<h3><a name="PCA"></a>6.3.2 Dimensional Analysis</h3>

In <a href="SProp.html">Section&nbsp;6.2 "Structural Design Properties"</a> we have noted that even though metrics have been
defined to capture different aspects of a software design, in practice
they often are correlated with each other. That is, they measure
essentially the same thing - some of the metrics are redundant.<p>

Redundant metrics provide no new design information. They can be
discarded without loss of information, and should be discarded to
facilitate the use of measurement data for decision making. Design
measurement tools often come with a large set of metrics, and you
should expect many of metrics to be redundant. SDMetrics is no
exception here.<p>

The difficulty is that, depending on design practices used in a
development environment, two metrics may be redundant in one software
system, but not in another. There is no such thing as a canonical set
of non-redundant metrics that captures all important design
properties and is valid for all systems. Therefore, SDMetrics opts for
a rich set of metrics, to lower the risk of missing important
design aspects, at the prize of some redundancy among the metrics.<p>

Techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to
identify and eliminate redundant metrics. PCA is a standard technique
to identify the underlying, orthogonal dimensions (which correspond to
properties that are directly or indirectly measured) that explain
relations between the variables in a data set. Examples of the
application of PCA are demonstrated in 
[<a href="References.html#References_BWDP00">BWDP00</a>,<a href="References.html#References_BWL01">BWL01</a>].<p>

Using a technique such as PCA within a few projects, you can identify
a reduced set of largely orthogonal metrics for your development
environment.
