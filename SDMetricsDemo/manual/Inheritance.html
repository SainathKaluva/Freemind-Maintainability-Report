<i>Definition</i><p>

Inheritance-related metrics are concerned with aspects such as
<ul>
<li>depth/width of the inheritance graph
<li>number of ancestors/descendents of a design element
<li>inherited size
<li>polymorphism, method overriding, etc.
</ul>

<i>Impact on quality</i><p>

Deep inheritance structures are hypothesized to be more fault-prone.
The information needed to fully understand a class situated deep in
the inheritance tree is spread over several ancestor classes, thus
more difficult to overview.<p>

Similar to high export coupling, a modification to a design element
with a large number of descendents can have a large effect on the
system. Make sure the interface of the class is stable, or that
anticipated modifications can be added without affecting the
inheritance hierarchy at large.<p>

<i>Empirical results</i><p>

Empirical studies show that effects of the use of inheritance on
system qualities such as fault-proneness vary greatly. Depending on
factors such as developer experience, system quality can benefit or
suffer from the use of inheritance, or be unaffected by it.<p>

Thus, inheritance metrics should not be relied on for decision making
before their impact on system quality is not demonstrated in a given
development environment. Extant inheritance metrics per se are not
suitable to distinguish proper use of inheritance from improper
use.<p>

Also, inheritance is not very frequently used in designs. Typically,
only a small percentage of the classes in a system will participate
in inheritance relationships. As a consequence, inheritance-related
metrics tend to have low variance and are difficult to use
(see <a href="DescStats.html">Section&nbsp;6.3.1 "Descriptive Statistics"</a>).
