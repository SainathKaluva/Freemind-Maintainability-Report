<h2><a name="DefRelMat"></a>8.4 Definition of Relation Matrices</h2>

The metric definition file also hosts the definition of SDMetrics'
relation matrices (see <a href="RelMat.html">Section&nbsp;4.10 "The View 'Relation Matrices'"</a>). The SDMetricsML defines a 
relation matrix with an XML element as follows:

<pre>
&lt;matrix name="matrixname" from_row_type="rowtype" to_col_type="columtype" 
        row_condition="..." col_condition="..." &gt; 
  &lt;description&gt;Description of the matrix.&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;'matrix definition' ...&gt;
&lt;/matrix&gt;
</pre>

The attributes in the opening "matrix" tag are:
<ul>
<li><tt>name</tt> (required): the name of the matrix, used in the dropdown list
of the relation matrix view, and as filename when saving the
relation matrix to files.

<li><tt>from_row_type</tt> (required): the type of the source elements that will
make up the rows of the matrix (e.g., package, class, operation).

<li><tt>to_col_type</tt> (required): the type of target elements that will make
up the columns of the matrix. This can be the same type as the row
elements, or a different type.

<li><tt>row_condition</tt> (optional): a condition expression (see <a href="DefCondExp.html">Section&nbsp;8.5.4 "Condition Expressions"</a>)
that must be true for a source element to be included in the matrix rows.
If the attribute is not specified, all source elements will be included.

<li><tt>col_condition</tt> (optional): a condition expression that must
be true for a target element to be included in the matrix columns.
If the attribute is not specified, all target elements will be included.

</ul>

Following the matrix tag is an optional description of the matrix,
enclosed in <tt>&lt;description&gt;</tt> tags. The description is
shown in the measurement catalog (see <a href="MetCat.html">Section&nbsp;4.13 "The View 'Catalog'"</a>).

<a href="WriteDesc.html">Section&nbsp;8.6 "Writing Descriptions"</a> explains how to write descriptions for matrices.<p>

The matrix definition is an XML element that defines the calculation
procedure establishing the relationship from source elements to target
elements in the matrix. The available procedures are the same ones
that are available for set definitions (see <a href="DefSets.html">Section&nbsp;8.2 "Definition of Sets"</a>).<p>

The definition below calculates a relation matrix showing UML
abstractions for classes, i.e., which classes implement which
interfaces:

<pre>
&lt;matrix name="UMLAbstr" from_row_type="class" to_col_type="interface"&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;UML abstractions: implementation of interfaces.&lt;/description&gt; 
  &lt;projection relation="client" target="abstraction" element="supplier" /&gt; 
&lt;/matrix&gt;
</pre>

The evaluation procedure for this matrix definition is as follows.
For a source element in a given matrix row, the projection is
evaluated, as described in <a href="SetProjection.html">Section&nbsp;8.2.1 "Projection"</a>. The number of
occurrences of each target element in that projection is counted, and
entered in the respective column of the relation matrix. This
procedure is repeated for all rows of the matrix. Thus, we obtain in
every table cell, a count of the number of relationship links from the
source element to the target element.<p>

In the context of a relation matrix definition, the set projection
attribute <tt>recurse</tt> is not allowed.<p>

As another example, assume we have defined, for a class, the set
&quot;AssEl_out&quot; of elements associated with the class by
bidirectional or navigable outgoing associations. We can then simply
create a relation matrix showing these associations as follows:

<pre>
&lt;matrix name="ICAssoc_Cls" from_row_type="class" to_col_type="class"&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;Import coupling via associations between classes.&lt;/description&gt; 
  &lt;projection relset="AssEl_out" /&gt; 
&lt;/matrix&gt;
</pre>

The evaluation procedure for this matrix definition is
straightforward. For a source element in a given matrix row, the
specified set expression &quot;relset&quot; is evaluated, as described
in <a href="SetProjection.html">Section&nbsp;8.2.1 "Projection"</a>. For each target element, the value of the
respective column of the relation matrix is the cardinality of the
target element in the set. This procedure is repeated for all rows of
the matrix.<p>

Continuing the association matrix example from above, we may want 
to reduce the size of the matrix by dropping empty rows 
(classes without outgoing associations), and empty columns 
(classes without incoming associations). Assume we have defined
two helper metrics "Num_AssEl_out" and "Num_AssEl_in", to 
count for a class the number of outgoing and incoming associations, 
respectively. We add row and column conditions to the matrix 
definition as follows:

<pre>
&lt;matrix name="ICAssoc_Cls" from_row_type="class" to_col_type="class"
        row_condition="Num_AssEl_out&gt;0" col_condition="Num_AssEl_in&gt;0"&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;Import coupling via associations between classes.&lt;/description&gt; 
  &lt;projection relset="AssEl_out" /&gt; 
&lt;/matrix&gt;
</pre>

Then, only classes with one ore more outgoing associations 
(<tt>Num_AssEl_out&gt;0</tt>) will be included in the rows of the matrix, 
which eliminates empty rows. Likewise, the column condition <tt>Num_AssEl_in&gt;0</tt>
eliminates empty columns.
