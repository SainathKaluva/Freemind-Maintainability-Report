<h3><a name="ProfUML2"></a>8.7.1 Profiles in UML 2</h3>

UML2 profiles provide a mechanism to extend and adapt the UML metamodel
for particular domains, platforms, or methods. A UML profile defines a set 
of stereotypes, which extend existing UML meta-classes by adding new
properties (via "tagged values"), imposing additional constraints, and
providing alternative graphical representations for the extended elements.<p>

The profile mechanism is a lightweight extension mechanism; it does not
allow for modifying existing meta-classes or creating new, 
"first-class citizen" meta-classes in the UML metamodel. UML profiles can, 
in theory, be easily imported and exchanged between UML tools, and
dynamically applied, combined, and retracted from a UML model.<p>

The most prominent example of a UML profile is probably the Systems 
Modeling Language (SysML), maintained by the Object Management Group 
[<a href="References.html#References_OMG10">OMG10</a>].
SysML is an extension of the UML to better support systems engineering.
Other profiles maintained by the OMG include
MARTE (Modeling and Analysis of Real-time and Embedded Systems),
UTP (UML Testing Profile), and SoaML (Service oriented architecture
Modeling Language).<p>

<b>How are UML profiles relevant to design quality measurement?</b><p>

If you extensively use profiles in your models, it is useful to
define design metrics and rules that take profile extensions into 
account. A SysML model, for example, contains elements such
"blocks", "requirements", or "test cases", and relationships
between them such as "allocate", "refine", or "verify", all
defined by the SysML profile. 
As a SysML user, you may therefore be interested in the number
of blocks and requirements in the packages, measure the size of blocks
in terms of their part-, reference-, and value-properties, define
rules such as "requirements that are not further decomposed or refined must
be verified by a test case", or create a relation matrix showing the 
allocation of activities to blocks.<p>
