<h3><a name="RuleFilter"></a>4.7.1 Filtering Design Rules</h3>

Some design rules only apply to certain types of UML models, e.g.,
models at a particular development phase (e.g., requirements, analysis,
design), models of a particular application domain
(e.g., embedded systems, real time systems), etc.<p>

The measurement catalog indicates the applicable types of models for
each rule. With the design rule filter, you can instruct
SDMetrics to only check and report design rules that apply to your
model at hand.<p>

<b>Writing Rule Filters</b><p>

Table&nbsp;3 shows some example filters and explains their
function. For the example, we assume we have four application areas
defined: 
<ul>
<li><code>analysis</code> (rules for analysis models) 
<li><code>design</code> (rules for design models)
<li><code>realtime</code> (rules for models of real-time systems)
<li><code>pedantic</code> (rules about obsessive details)
</ul>


<table>
<tr><th>Example Filter</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>design</code></td><td>

To only check the rules of one application area, simply specify the
name of that application area.<br>
The example filter only checks rules that are applicable at the design
phase.<br>

</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>design&amp;realtime</code></td><td>

To check rules applicable to all of several areas, combine the areas
with the &amp; operator.<br>
The example filter only checks rules that are applicable to real-time
systems at the design phase.

</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>analysis|design</code></td><td>

To check rules applicable to at least one of several areas, combine
the areas with the | operator.<br>
The example filter only checks rules that are applicable at the
analysis phase or at the design phase.<br>

</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>!analysis</code></td><td>

To check rules that do not apply to a particular area, precede the
name of the area with the ! operator.<br> 
The example filter only checks rules that do not apply to the analysis
phase.<br>

</td></tr>
<tr><td> <code>'design'</code></td><td>

Some rules do not explicitly define an application area. Such rules
are implied to apply to all areas. Therefore, the
filter <code>design</code> will also check rules that do not specify
any application area at all.<br>

To instruct SDMetrics to only check rules that <i>explicitly</i> are
defined for an application area, put the application area in single
quotes.<br>
The example filter only checks design rules which explicitly list
"design" among their application areas.

</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>design&amp;<br>
(!'realtime'|pedantic)</code></td><td>

Using parentheses, you can define arbitrarily complex rule filters.
The example filter checks all rules applicable to the design phase
that are also not explicitly defined for real-time systems or are
pedantic.

</td></tr> </table>
<b>Table 3:&nbsp;Rule filter examples.</b><p>

<b>Applying Rule Filters</b><p>

To apply a filter, specify it in the "filter" text field at the top of
the rule checker view, and press return or click the "Apply" button.
To clear the filter, and show all design rule violations regardless of
their application area, click the "Clear" button.<p>

If your filter contains a syntax error (illegal operation, unmatched
parentheses etc.) you will get an error message and the rules will not
be checked. If your filter specifies an application area that is not
defined explicitly by at least one rule, SDMetrics will warn you about
this, but will check the rules anyway.
