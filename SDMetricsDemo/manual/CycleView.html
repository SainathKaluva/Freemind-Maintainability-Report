Figure&nbsp;18 shows the register tab for viewing cycles in graphs.<p>

<b>Figure 18:&nbsp;Graph Structures View - Cycles</b><p>

There is one graph for each design rule that checks for cycles. From
the dropdown list at the top, you can select the design rule for which
you want to show the cycles. Click the "Show full definition" button to
open the definition of the rule in the measurement catalog (<a href="MetCat.html">Section&nbsp;4.13 "The View 'Catalog'"</a>).<p>

The tree below initially shows all model elements that depend on at
least one other model element. The type of model elements and nature
of the dependencies are defined by the selected design rule.
Expand the model elements to the see on which other elements they depend.
The icon next to each model element indicates its cycle status:

<ul>
<li>Red icon: The element has dependencies and is part of one or more cycles.
<li>Yellow icon: The element has dependencies but is not part of any cycle.
<li>White icon: The element has no dependencies.
</ul>

By expanding the elements with red icons, you can quickly trace the cycles
present in the design. Note that the dependency tree is always shown, even 
if there are no cycles at all.<p>

Use the "Reverse direction" button in the upper right corner
to switch to a new tree that reverses the direction of the
dependencies. Expanding a model element <i>e</i> shows all model elements that depend
on&nbsp;<i>e</i>.<p>
