<a name="Glossary_Coupling"></a>
<i>Definition</i><p>

Coupling is the degree to which the elements in a design are
connected. <p>

<i>Impact on quality</i><p>

Coupling connections cause dependencies between design elements,
which, in turn, have an impact on system qualities such as
maintainability (a modification of a design element may require
modifications to its connected elements) or testability (a fault in
one design element may cause a failure in a completely different,
connected element). Thus, a common design principle is to minimize
coupling.<p>

Most coupling dependencies are directed - the coupling usually defines
a client-supplier relationship between the design elements.
Therefore, it is useful to distinguish import coupling ("using", "fan-out") and
export coupling ("used", "fan-in"), which we discuss in the following.<p>

<a name="Glossary_Coupling (import)"></a>
<b>Import coupling</b><p>

Import coupling measures the degree to which an element has
knowledge of, uses, or depends on other design elements. High
import coupling can have the following effects:

<ul>
<li>Decreased maintainability: changes to the supplier may necessitate
follow-up changes (ripple effects) to the client.<br> 
The stability of the supplier is a factor to consider here. High
coupling to elements that are not likely to change is less harmful
than coupling to "hot spots".

<li>Decreased understandability, increased fault-proneness: elements
with high import coupling operate in large context, developers need to
know all the services the element relies on, and how to use them.

<li>Decreased reusability: To reuse a class or package with high
import coupling in a new context, all the required services must also
be made available in the new context.
</ul>

<a name="Glossary_Coupling (export)"></a>
<b>Export coupling</b><p>

Export coupling measures the degree to which an element is used by,
depended upon, by other design elements. High export coupling is often
observed for general utility classes (e.g., for string handling or
logging services) that are used pervasively across all layers of the
system. Thus, high export coupling is not necessarily indicative of
bad design.<p>

Again, an important issue to consider here is stability. High export
coupling elements that are likely to change in the future can have a
large impact on the system if the change affects the
interface. Therefore, high export classes should be reviewed for
anticipated changes, to ensure that these changes can implemented with
minimal impact.<p>

<i>Empirical results</i><p>

Coupling metrics have consistently been found to be good indicators
of fault-proneness. It seems worthwhile to investigate different
dimensions of coupling: import and export coupling, different coupling
mechanisms, distinguishing coupling to COTS libraries and
application-specific classes/packages. Coupling metrics are suitable
to identify design elements with high fault density. Therefore,
coupling metrics greatly help to identify small parts of a design
that contain a large number of faults.<p>
