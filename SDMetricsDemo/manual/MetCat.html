The catalog view shows the definitions of the metrics, design
rules, and relation matrices for the current data set, and provides
literature references and a glossary for them.<p>

<b>Selecting tables</b><p>

From the dropdown list at the top of the catalog, you can select the
following items to explore:

<ul>

<li>Metrics - lists all design metrics in the table. For each metric,
the table shows the name of the metric, its domain (the type of
element it measures), its category (the property it measures), and a
brief description.

<li>Rules - lists all design rules in the table. For each rule, the
table shows the name of the rule, its domain (the element type it
applies to), its category, its severity, its applicable areas, as well
as a brief description of the rule.

<li>Matrices - lists the relation matrices in the table. For each
matrix, the table shows the types of elements in the rows and
columns, and a brief description of the matrix.

<li>References - shows a list of literature references and their
bibliographic citations.

<li>Glossary - shows a list of measurement terms with definitions.

</ul>

<b>Showing detailed descriptions</b><p>

Click any row in the table to see a detailed description of the
selected item in the lower part of the window.<p>

The detailed descriptions often contain cross-references to other
metrics, rules, or matrices, include literature references, or
reference terms from the glossary. These references are hyperlinks that
take you to the full definition of the referenced item.
Use the <img src="images/histback.gif"> and <img
src="images/histforw.gif"> arrows in the upper right corner of the catalog view to
move back and forth within the previously visited definitions.<p>

<b>Sorting tables</b><p>

You can sort each table by its columns, e.g., to quickly find all
metrics for a particular domain, all rules of certain severity level,
and so on. <a href="CommonControls.html">Section&nbsp;4.3.1 "Common controls in views"</a> describes how to sort tables.
