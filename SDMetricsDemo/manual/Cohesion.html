<a name="Glossary_Cohesion"></a>
<i>Definition</i><p>

Cohesion is the degree to which the elements in a design unit
(package, class etc.) are logically related, or "belong together". As
such, cohesion is a semantic concept.<p>

Cohesion metrics have been proposed which attempt to approximate this
semantic concept using syntactical criteria. Such metrics quantify the
connectivity (coupling) between elements of the design unit: the
higher the connectivity between elements, the higher the cohesion.<p>

Cohesion metrics often are normalized to have a notion of minimum and
maximum cohesion, usually expressed on a scale from 0 to 1. Minimum
cohesion (0) is assumed when the elements are entirely unconnected,
maximum cohesion (1) is assumed when each element is connected to
every other element.<p>

Not normalized metrics are based on counts of connections between
design elements in a unit (e.g., method calls within a class). As
such, not normalized metrics are conceptually similar to complexity
metrics.<p>

<i>Impact on quality</i><p>

A low cohesive design element has been assigned many unrelated
responsibilities. Consequently, the design element is more difficult
to understand and therefore also harder to maintain and reuse. Design
elements with low cohesion should be considered for refactoring, for
instance, by extracting parts of the functionality to separate classes
with clearly defined responsibilities.<p>

<i>Empirical results</i><p>

In practice, cohesion metrics are only of limited usefulness:

<ul>
<li>Not normalized cohesion metrics often are strongly related to size
metrics. This makes sense since, as discussed in the section on size
metrics, large classes or packages may in fact suffer from low
cohesion. Such cohesion metrics then are, of course, good quality
indicators, but they are redundant with size metrics - they
provide no new information about the design element.</li>

<li>Normalized cohesion metrics do not consistently have a bearing on
system qualities. I.e., we cannot conclude from a high or low cohesion
value that a class is, e.g., more or less fault-prone. Either, the
theoretical negative impact of low cohesion on system quality is not
always that critical in practice, or, the cohesion metrics simply fail
to identify design elements with unrelated responsibilities.
</li>
</ul>
