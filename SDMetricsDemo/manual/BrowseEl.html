<h2><a name="BrowseEl"></a>4.6 The View 'Kiviat Diagrams'</h2>

This view shows information for one UML design element at a
time. On the control panel to the left, you can choose the element to
display. The panel on the right hand side graphically displays the
values of all metrics defined for the element.<p>

<b>Figure 11:&nbsp;Kiviat Diagram View</b><p>

Select the element to display from the tree at the top of the control
panel. You can adjust the size of the tree with the separator bars
below and to the right. Use the <img alt="Left button"
src="images/prev.gif"><img alt="Up button"src="images/up.gif"><img
alt="Right button" src="images/next.gif"> buttons or the cursor keys
to navigate through the tree.<p>

The graph on the right hand side is a so-called Kiviat diagram,
showing the measurement values of all metrics for the selected
element. Each axis (or ray) of the graph represents one metric, as
labeled in the graph. The measurement scale of each axis is the range
of the metric: the minimum value is located in the center, the maximum
value at the outer end. The axes are linearly scaled.<p>

The thick line connects the measurement values of the selected element
for each metric on the axes. If the element has many relatively large
values, the area enclosed by the thick line will be large. So the size
of the enclosed area serves as an indicator of the criticality of the
element.<p>

Note that metrics with non-numerical values, or metrics that do not
vary at all, are not suitable for the graph and therefore omitted. Also, the Kiviat graph
can only be shown for elements with at least three suitable metrics. If you see
a "Diagram not available" message instead of a graph, there are less
than three suitable metrics for the selected element type.<p>

Below the element tree you can choose to display information about
metric percentiles of the selected model element, or to display the
descriptive statistics for a metric shown in the graph.<p>

<b>Percentiles</b><p>

The percentiles table shows, for various percentiles (column
"Prctl."), the number of metrics for which the measurement values
exceed the percentile for the selected element (column
"Count"). Assuming we mostly deal with metrics where higher values
indicate lower quality, a design element should be considered critical
if a larger number of metric values for the element are in the upper
percentiles (e.g., 90th, 95th).<p>

The percentiles table also controls which percentiles of the metrics
are displayed in the graph. Check the boxes in the column "Draw" for
the percentiles to display. This gives an indication how the
measurement values of the selected element compare to all other
elements. Column "Color" indicates the color for each percentile on
the graph.<p>

<b>Descriptive Statistics</b><p>

If you click near one of the axis in the Kiviat diagram, a short
definition of the metric and its descriptive statistics with minimum
and maximum values will be displayed on this tab.<p>

The context menu of the graph provides links the measurement
catalog (see <a href="MetCat.html">Section&nbsp;4.13 "The View 'Catalog'"</a>) and histogram (see <a href="BrowseMet.html">Section&nbsp;4.5 "The View 'Histograms'"</a>)
for the metric of the nearest axis.
