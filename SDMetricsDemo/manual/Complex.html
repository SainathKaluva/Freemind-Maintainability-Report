<i>Definition</i><p> 

Complexity measures the degree of connectivity between elements of a
design unit. Whereas size counts the elements in a design unit,
and coupling the relationships/dependencies leaving the design unit
boundary, complexity is concerned with the relationships/dependencies between
the elements in the design unit. For instance, counting the number
method invocations among the methods within one class can be
considered a measure of class complexity, or the number of transitions
between the states in a state diagram.<p>

<i>Impact on quality</i><p>

High complexity of interactions between the elements of a design unit
can lead to decreased understandability and therefore increased
fault-proneness. Also, testing such design units is more difficult.<p>

<i>Empirical results</i><p>

In practice, complexity metrics are often strongly correlated with
size measures. Large design units that contain many design elements
within are also more likely to have a large number of connections
between the design elements.<p>

Thus, while complexity metrics are good indicators of qualities such
as fault-proneness, they provide no new insights in addition to size
metrics.
