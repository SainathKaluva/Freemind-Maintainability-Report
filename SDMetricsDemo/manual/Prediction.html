<h3><a name="Prediction"></a>6.3.5 Prediction Models</h3>

Prediction models try to estimate the future quality of a system from
internal quality attributes that are measurable at present. This is
achieved by empirically exploring the relationships between internal
and external quality from systems developed in the past, and
applying these findings to new systems.<p>

In the following, we describe how to build and use a prediction model
for class fault-proneness from the structural properties of a
class. Figure&nbsp;32 depicts the steps involved in building the
prediction model.<p>

<b>Figure 32:&nbsp;Building a Prediction Model</b><p>

The starting point is a system design that has been created in the
past. We apply SDMetrics to the design to obtain structural properties
data for the classes in the design, collected from the various diagram
types (class, object, collaboration, sequence, and state diagrams). In
addition, fault data (e.g., from inspections, testing, or post-release
faults) has to be collected and the faults per class recorded.<p>

We now have a set of classes enriched with structural properties data
and fault data. On this data set we perform a statistical analysis
(e.g. classification or regression analysis) to identify relationships
between fault data and structural properties. The result of this
analysis is a prediction model, e.g., in the form of a regression
equation. The prediction model computes a predicted fault-proneness or
predicted number of faults from the structural properties of a class.
This model can be used to make predictions for new classes, as
depicted in Figure&nbsp;33.<p>

The starting point in applying the prediction model is a new design
candidate. We apply SDMetrics to this design to again obtain the
structural properties measurement data for the classes. This data is
then fed into the prediction model. Using the now known relationship
between the structural properties and faults, the prediction model
calculates, for instance, for each class a probability that a fault
will be found in the class upon inspection.<p>

The output of the prediction model is useful for decision-making. For
instance, we may decide that for classes with a high predicted
fault-proneness, say, above 25%, the class design shall undergo
quality assurance (QA) activities such as inspections, extensive unit
testing etc. Or, we may rank the classes by their predicted
fault-proneness, and select the highly fault-prone classes from the
top of the list for QA activities, until the allocated resources for
QA are depleted.<p>

Thus, the effort for QA activities can be focused on the classes that
are more likely to contain faults. The benefits are manifold:<p>
<ul>
<li>effectiveness of QA increases,
<li>system quality increases as more faults are found,
<li>development cost decreases as faults are found earlier when they
are cheaper to repair.
</ul>

Note: what kind of prediction the model makes - e.g., predicted number
of faults, or the likelihood a fault is found in a class during
inspection, testing, or post-release - depends on the statistical
analysis techniques used, and the type of fault data from which the
model is built.<p>

Prediction models for other system qualities can be built in the same
way, for example, models to predict implementation and test effort
from design size.<p>

The advantage of using prediction models is that they provide a
mapping from hard-to-interpret design measurement data ("size=12,
coupling=7, ...") to easily interpreted external quality data
("predicted fault-proneness of class X: 78%", "predicted effort to
implement package Y: 104 person hours"). The result is an absolute,
quantitative statement (within certain error bars) about the external 
quality of a system, expressed in the same unit in which the external quality is
measured.<p>

Also, prediction models address the problem that a complex system
quality attribute such as fault-proneness is influenced by many
factors - various dimensions of size, coupling and so on. Approaches
such as quality benchmarks, which investigate one design metric at a
time to characterize fault-proneness, fail to take the combined effect
of all factors into account. Prediction models provide a sound method
to combine these multiple factors into one cohesive model.<p>

Empirical evidence shows that highly accurate prediction models can be
built from structural properties, and that they are beneficial in
highlighting trouble areas, as well as in supporting project planning
and steering [<a href="References.html#References_BWDP00">BWDP00</a>,
