<h3><a name="ProfOpt3"></a>8.7.6 Extension References with Inheritance</h3>

For the purpose of defining design metrics and rules, it is still
cumbersome to have two model elements in the model to logically represent a single 
element. Consider for example metric "NumCls" for packages to count the number
of classes in the package. This is the definition of the metric that ships with
SDMetrics ever since its first release in 2002:

<pre>
&lt;metric name="NumCls" domain="package"&gt;
  &lt;projection relation="context" target="class" /&gt;
&lt;/metric&gt;
</pre>

Applied to our sample package with four requirements, this metric will include the 
class elements to represent the requirements in its class count. Depending
on our measurement goals, this may not be what we want. We could of course adjust 
the definition of the metric to only count classes that do not represent 
requirements:

<pre>
&lt;metric name="NumClsExceptRequirements" domain="package"&gt;
  &lt;projection relation="context" target="class" condition="Reqmt=''"/&gt;
&lt;/metric&gt;
</pre>

This approach is possible, but ugly. If we add support for SysML blocks or other
types that also extend "class", we would need to adjust the definition of metric
again to exclude classes representing blocks, etc.<p>

To better deal with these issues, SDMetrics provides a mechanism to merge the extended
element with its extending element to form a single model element that combines
all the information from both elements. To enable this mechanism, we have to define
the type of the extending element as a subtype of the extended element.<p>

In our SysML requirements example, we therefore change the definition of 
type "requirement" by declaring its parent to be type "class":

<pre>
&lt;modelelement name="requirement" <b>parent="class"</b>&gt;
  &lt;attribute name="base" <b>type="extref"</b> /&gt;
  &lt;attribute name="text" /&gt;
  &lt;attribute name="reqid" /&gt;
&lt;/modelelement&gt;
</pre>

If SDMetrics finds a model element of type <i>t</i> ("requirement" 
in our example) with an extension reference,
and the type of the extended element is a supertype of <i>t</i>
("class" in our example),
then SDMetrics will merge the two elements into one element
of type <i>t</i>. The merged element copies all attribute values of
the extended element, and the extended element is removed from
the model. We are left with one element of type <i>t</i>
that assumes the place of the extended element.<p>

Applied to our sample model and XMI file, we end up with a model
that contains four requirement elements, no classes, and maintains 
the expected containment hierarchy:

<pre>
Model "Sample"
  Package "Specifications"
    Requirement "XZY" with Id "R1"
    Requirement "ABC" with Id "R2"
      Requirement "A" with Id "R2.1"
      Requirement "B" with Id "R2.2"
</pre>

The package "Specification" no longer contains elements of type "class",
and metric NumCls will yield 0. Model element type "requirement" has become
a full, first-class citizen. We can identify requirements simply by
the type of the model element, the need for helper metrics is eliminated.<p>

Using reference extensions with inheritance, it is very easy to define
metrics that take more complex relationships into account. 
For example, the SysML defines a relationship "satisfy" to identify 
the model elements that fulfill a given requirement. The more elements
are needed to satisfy a requirement, the more difficult the requirement
will be to change. We are therefore going to define a metric that counts the 
number of elements that satisfy a requirement.<p>

Technically, the SysML defines the "satisfy" relationship as a stereotype 
that extends the meta-class "abstraction". We therefore create a new model 
element type "satisfy" with an extension reference as a subtype of "abstraction" 
(see <a href="Meta2.html">Appendix&nbsp;A.2 "Metamodel for UML 2.x"</a>):

<pre>
&lt;modelelement name="satisfy" parent="abstraction"&gt;
  &lt;attribute name="base" type="extref" /&gt;
&lt;/modelelement&gt;
</pre>

The type "satisfy" inherits the multi-valued reference attributes
"client" and "supplier" from "abstraction". For the XMI transformation,
we only have to provide a trigger for the new extension reference "base":
<pre>
&lt;xmitransformation modelelement="satisfy" xmipattern="sysml:Satisfy"&gt;
  &lt;trigger name="base" type="attrval" attr="base_Abstraction" /&gt;
&lt;/xmitransformation&gt;
</pre>

We can then define our metric to count the number of elements that 
satisfy a requirement: 

<pre>
&lt;metric name="Satisfiers" domain="requirement" category="Coupling (export)"&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;The number of elements that satisfy this requirement.&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;projection relation="supplier" target="satisfy" sum="size(client)"/&gt;
&lt;/metric&gt;
</pre>
