<h4><a name="Recurse"></a>8.1.1.8 Attribute "recurse"</h4>

With the "recurse" attribute, you can define metrics that take the
transitive closure of relations or sets into account. The recurse
attribute takes the values "true" or "false" (default).<p>

Setting the value of "recurse" to true changes the meaning of a metric
<i>m</i> for elements of type <i>t</i> as follows: in addition to
processing the projection attributes as usual, apply metric <i>m</i>
to all "compatible" elements in the projection, and add the result to 
the return value of the metric. An element is "compatible" if its type is <i>t</i>,
or if its type is a subtype or supertype of <i>t</i> and metric
<i>m</i> is defined for the type.<p>

<pre>
&lt;metric name="NumCls_tc" domain="package"&gt; 
  &lt;description&gt;The number of classes in a package, 
  its subpackages, and so on.&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;projection relation="context" target="class" recurse="true"/&gt;
&lt;/metric&gt;
</pre>

Without the "recurse" attribute being set to true, the above metric
would just count the number of classes in a package. With recurse set
to true, metric NumCls_tc is in addition recursively applied to all
subpackages that are in the context of a package, and the values added
up. As result, you not only obtain the number of classes in the
package, but also in its subpackages, sub-subpackages, and so on. In
Figure&nbsp;35, the metric NumCls_tc yields the following values:<p>

<table><tr><th>Package</th><th>NumCls_tc</th></tr>
<tr><td>package1</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>package1.1</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>package1.1.1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>package1.2</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table><p>
<b>Table 4:&nbsp;Example package metrics</b><p>

As another example, the number of descendents of a class can be defined
as follows:

<pre>
&lt;metric name="NumDesc" domain="class"&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;The number of descendents of a class.&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;projection relation="genparent" target="generalization" 
              element="genchild" eltype="class" recurse="true"/&gt; 
&lt;/metric&gt;
</pre>

Without the "recurse" attribute, this metric would count the number of
children of a class. With "recurse" being set to true, the metric
NumDesc is recursively evaluated for each child class, and added to
the total.<p>

Care must be taken when the "recurse" attribute is combined with the
filter attributes (target, targetcondition, eltype, element,
condition, scope). The filter attributes are NOT evaluated for the
selection of elements on which to apply the metric recursively. The
metric is always recursively applied to all elements in the unfiltered
projection that are compatible with the element for which the
metric is calculated. Consider this example:

<pre>
&lt;metric name="NumDesc_SameScope" domain="class"&gt;
  &lt;projection relation="genparent" target="generalization" 
              element="genchild" eltype="class"
              scope="same" recurse="true"/&gt; 
&lt;/metric&gt;
</pre>

This will not work. While only child classes in the same scope are
counted, the metric is recursively applied to all child classes
(regardless of their scope), and the number of their "same scope
descendents" is added to the total. To define the intended metric, you
would first define the set (see <a href="DefSetExp.html">Section&nbsp;8.5.3 "Set Expressions"</a>) of descendents of the
class, and then define a projection to filter the classes with the
desired scope in that set.
