<h3><a name="ProfTips"></a>8.7.7 Tips on Creating Metrics and Rules for Profile Extensions</h3>

We have discussed three options to deal with stereotypes in
UML profiles:
<ul>
<li>option 1: using regular model elements
<li>option 2: using extension references without inheritance
<li>option 3: using extension references with inheritance
</ul>

Here are some guidelines to decide which option to use for
a given stereotype.

<ul>
<li>How often do you need to distinguish elements to which the
stereotype is applied from elements of the same type to which 
the stereotype is not applied?<p>
If, for example, the distinction between SysML FlowPorts and 
plain UML ports is only relevant for a few of your metrics and rules, 
and you can treat them equally as plain UML ports most of the 
time, option 1 or 2 is appropriate.<p>

<li>Do you need to identify the extension elements in the metric,
rule, or relation matrix data tables?<p>If so, you have to choose 
option 2 or 3.<p>

<li>How much does the stereotype application change the
"character" or "nature" of the extended model element?<p>
In case of SysML requirements, for example, the characteristic
of the "class" element changes considerably. Unlike regular classes, 
requirements can't have operations or attributes, do not participate in 
associations, can't be generalized, and are usually not 
instantiated. They are actually not much like classes at all.<p>
In such situations, option 3 is appropriate, because it
eliminates the "class" element representing the requirement 
from the model, and existing metrics and rules that involve
classes will ignore the extended element.<p>
<li>How important or central is the concept of the extension
in the profile?<p>
Like requirements, a SysML block extends UML meta-class "class".
Unlike requirements, however, SysML blocks maintain most of 
the class features from UML. Yet, as blocks are the central
modular structure units of the SysML, the set of metrics and
rules to calculate for blocks will probably be quite different
from the set of class metrics and rules. Option 3 is therefore
the best choice for the central concepts of the profile.<p>
<li>How many meta-classes does the stereotype extend?<p>
If the stereotype extends two or more meta-classes
(for example, SysML TestCase can extend "operation"
or "behavior"), you can use option 3 for at most one
of the extension, and must use option 1 or 2 for all 
others. This is because SDMetrics' metamodeling facility
does not support multiple inheritance. 
</ul>

Using extension references with inheritance, the inheritance mechanism
plays a more important role in the SDMetrics metamodel. With the support 
for profiles, a number of features were introduced to provide more flexibility
dealing with inheritance:

<ul>
<li>inheritance of metric, set, and rule definitions to pass
selected metrics, sets, and rules on to descended types 
(see e.g. <a href="DefMetrics.html">Section&nbsp;8.1 "Definition of Metrics"</a> for metric inheritance)
<li>metrics or sets involving recursion or nesting extend their
recursion to compatible super- and subclasses
(see e.g. <a href="Recurse.html">Section&nbsp;8.1.1.8 "Attribute "recurse""</a>)
<li>filtering for subtypes with the "target" and "eltype" 
filter attributes (see <a href="Target.html">Section&nbsp;8.1.1.3 "Filter Attribute "target""</a>).
<li>new function "instanceof" (see <a href="BoolFct.html">Section&nbsp;8.5.4.2 "Boolean Functions"</a>)
</ul>


<b>Where to go from here</b><p>

On the SDMetrics web site, you can download a set of project files
for SysML 1.2, with metrics and rules that cover block definition diagrams, 
internal block diagrams, parametric diagrams, and requirement diagrams.
