<h3><a name="Ranking"></a>6.3.3 Rankings</h3>

Most metrics have an underlying hypothesis of the form: the higher the
measurement value (e.g., size, import coupling), the stronger the
negative impact on quality (fault-proneness, effort, maintainability).
Therefore, when considered in isolation, design metrics only allow
relative statements about the system quality, e.g. "package A displays
stronger coupling than package B, therefore, package A is more likely
to suffer from quality problems than package B."<p>

An admissible interpretation is therefore to sort the model elements
by a metric, and review the design of the model elements with the
highest values: Are those high values justified, should the model
element be considered critical?<p>

There is no definitive answer to the question how many elements to
choose for review from the top of the sorted list. One strategy could
be to select so-called "outliers". Another strategy could be to select
a certain number or percentage of model elements from the top, based
on available resources for reviewing.<p>

SDMetrics supports this kind of interpretation of measurement data.
The histograms in the metric view allow you to visually identify
outliers (<a href="BrowseMet.html">Section&nbsp;4.5 "The View 'Histograms'"</a>). In the table view, you can sort the
elements by a metric, and highlight elements in the upper percentiles
for a metric (<a href="TableView.html">Section&nbsp;4.4 "The View 'Metric Data Tables'"</a>).<p>

<b>What about thresholds?</b><p>

One recurring suggested use of design metrics is that they can be
used to build simple quality benchmarks based on thresholds. If a
design metric exceeds a certain threshold, the design element is
either rejected and must be redesigned, or at least flagged as
"critical". It is difficult to imagine why a threshold effect would
exist between, for example, size metrics and fault-proneness. This
would imply a sudden, steep increase in fault-proneness in a certain
size value range, something that would be difficult to explain. Also,
empirical data does not support this idea
