<h3><a name="DefSetExp"></a>8.5.3 Set Expressions</h3>

A set expression is an expression that returns a set. It is made up of
identifiers (names of sets), and set operations. Identifiers have been
described in <a href="Ident.html">Section&nbsp;8.5.1.2 "Identifiers"</a>. The admissible set operations are:
<ul>
<li>A+B: the union of A and B.<br>

If both A and B are regular sets, the resulting set will be a regular
set containing the elements that occur in A or in B or both.<br>

If A or B is a multiset, the resulting set will be a multiset,
respecting the cardinality of elements. For example, if element
<i>e</i> occurs five times in multiset A, and twice in multiset B, its
cardinality in the union is seven. If B is a regular set containing
element <i>e</i>, the cardinality of <i>e</i> in the union is six.

<li>A*B: the intersection of A and B.<br>

If A or B is a regular set, the resulting set will be a regular set
containing the elements that occur both in A and in B.<br>

If both A and B are multisets, the resulting set will be a multiset,
respecting the cardinality of elements. For example, if element
<i>e</i> occurs five times in multiset A, and twice in multiset B, its
cardinality in the intersection is two.

<li>A-B: A without B.<br>

If A is a regular set, the resulting set will be a regular set
containing all elements that occur in A but not in B.<br>

If A is a multiset, the resulting set will be a multiset, respecting
the cardinality of elements. For example, if element
<i>e</i> occurs five times in multiset A, and twice in multiset B, its
cardinality in the resulting set is three. If B is a regular set containing
element <i>e</i>, the cardinality of <i>e</i> in the resulting set is four.


<li> <tt>a</tt>.B: set B of model element <tt>a</tt>.<br> 
The dot operator (see <a href="DotOp.html">Section&nbsp;8.5.2.2 "Special Operators"</a>) is also available in set
expressions. The difference is that the right hand side, B, must be a
set expression. Evaluating expression <tt>a</tt>.B for model element
<i>e</i> thus works as follows:
<ul>
<li>Evaluate metric expression <tt>a</tt> for model element
<i>e</i>. This yields a second model element, <i>e'</i>.
<li>Evaluate set expression B for model element
<i>e'</i>. This is the result of <tt>a</tt>.B.
<li>If an error occurs during evaluation of expression <tt>a</tt> or
B, or if expression <tt>a</tt> does not yield a model
element, no error is reported. Instead, a regular empty set is
returned as value of <tt>a.B</tt>.
</ul>
</ul>
The dot operator has precedence over the * operator, which has precedence
over the + and - operators. A+B-C is equivalent to (A+B)-C, not A+(B-C). Use
parenthesis to enforce the intended precedence.<p>

An example for a valid set expression is ((A+B)-context.C)*D.
