<h3><a name="RuleAccepting"></a>4.7.2 Accepting Design Rule Violations</h3>

Rules are there to be bent once in a while. That is, sometimes there
is a justification why a particular model element should be allowed to
violate a particular rule. Such approved rule violations should not be
reported anymore for the model element. You achieve this with specific
tags or comments that you add to the model element in your UML tool.
The procedure differs for UML 1.x and UML 2.x models.<p>

<b>UML 1.x</b><p>
To allow a model element <i>e</i> to violate a rule named
<tt>rulename</tt>, define a tagged value for <i>e</i>, where the tag
name is <tt>violates_rulename</tt> (please refer to the manual of your
UML modeling tool for details on how to add tagged values). The value
of the tagged value pair is ignored by SDMetrics. You can use the value
for instance to document the reason why the model element is allowed
to violate the rule.<p>

For example, if after a design review a particular class is allowed to
violate rules named "GodClass" and "MultipleInheritance", you add two
tagged values to the class, one with tag <tt>violates_GodClass</tt>
and the other with the tag <tt>violates_MultipleInheritance</tt>. From
then on, violations of these two rules will no longer be reported for
that class (and only these two rules, and only for that class).<p>

<b>UML 2.x</b><p> 

UML 2 no longer has tagged values as they are known in UML 1.x, but
every model element can own comments. To exempt a model element from
one or more rules, add one or more comments where the body text
contains the string <tt>violates_rulename</tt> for each rule the model
element is allowed to violate. Please refer to the manual of your UML
modeling tool for details on how to add comments. An example comment
body text could be:<br> 
<tt>"violates_GodClass, violates_MultipleInheritance: confirmed in
review"</tt><p>

The comment's body can contain additional text before, after, or
between the <tt>violates_rulename</tt> tags. You can use this to
document the reason why the model element is allowed to violate the
rule.<p>

<b>Customizing rule exemption annotations</b><p>

If the above methods to mark elements as exempt from certain rules
do not suit you, the method is customizable to some degree,
see <a href="RuleExAttr.html">Section&nbsp;8.3.6 "Exempting Approved Rule Violations"</a>.<p>
