<h3><a name="Appearance"></a>4.16.4 Appearance</h3> 

Here you can customize several aspects of the appearance of the SDMetrics user
interface: font size, the look and feel and the design comparison colors.<p>

<b>Font size</b><p>

Click the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the font size
of SDMetrics' main window, menus, and dialogs. You can judge the 
resulting size by the preview fields next 
to the size adjustment controls.<p>

Make sure to change the font size in small steps and "within reason". Too large or
too small settings may render the application difficult or impossible 
to use.<p>

<b>Note:</b> you need to restart SDMetrics for the new font size to 
become effective.<p>

<b>Look and Feel</b><p>

To adjust the overall appearance - or look and feel - of SDMetrics,
you have the following choices:

<ul>

<li><b>Platform-specific</b>: Uses the look and feel that best matches
your operating system.
<li><b>Java Look and Feel</b>: The cross-platform look and feel
of Java (also known as &quot;Metal&quot; with &quot;Ocean Theme&quot;).
<li><b>Custom</b>: Here you can specify a custom look and feel, e.g.,
one provided by a third party. Refer to the documentation of the 
custom look and feel package for the class name
to enter in the text field, and make sure the class is included in
your CLASSPATH.<br> For example, to use Java's Nimbus look and feel,
enter:
<tt>com.sun.java.swing.plaf.nimbus.NimbusLookAndFeel</tt> 
(requires JRE6 update 10 or later).
</ul>

<b>Note:</b> you need to restart SDMetrics for the new look and feel 
settings to become effective.<p>

<b>Design Comparison Colors</b><p>

Here you can adjust the colors used to indicate added and deleted
elements or increased or decreased measurement values for design
comparisons (see <a href="CompDes.html">Section&nbsp;4.9 "The View 'Design Comparison'"</a>).<p>

Click the button for the color you like to change. This opens a
color chooser dialog where you can select the new color.
