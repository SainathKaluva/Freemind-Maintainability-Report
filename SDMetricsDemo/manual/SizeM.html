<i>Definition</i><p>

Design size metrics measure the size of design elements, typically by
counting the elements contained within. For example, the number of
operations in a class, the number of classes in a package, and so
on.<p>

<i>Impact on quality</i><p>

Size metrics are good candidates for developing cost or effort
estimates for implementation, review, testing, or maintenance
activities. Such estimates are then used as input for project planning
purposes and the allocation of personnel.<p>

In addition, large sized design elements (e.g., big classes or
packages) may suffer from poor design. In an iterative development
process, more and more functionality is added to a class or package
over time. The danger is that, eventually, many unrelated
responsibilities are assigned to a design element. As a result, it has
low functional cohesion. This in turn negatively impacts the
understandability, reusability, and maintainability of the design
element.<p>

Therefore, interfaces and implementations of large classes or packages
should be reviewed for functional cohesion. If there is no
justification for the large size, the design element should be
considered for refactoring, for instance, extract parts of the
functionality to separate, more cohesive classes.<p>

<i>Empirical results</i><p>

Empirical studies consistently confirm the importance of size as the
main cost driver in a software project.  Size metrics are also
consistently good indicators of fault-proneness: large
methods/classes/packages contain more faults. However, since size
metrics systematically identify large design elements as fault-prone,
these metrics alone are not suitable to find elements with high fault
density.
