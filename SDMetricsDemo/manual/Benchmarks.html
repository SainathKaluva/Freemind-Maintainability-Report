<h3><a name="Benchmarks"></a>6.3.4 Quality Benchmarks</h3>

The idea of benchmarks is to compare structural properties of a design
with properties of previous system designs that are 'known to be good'
and have stood the test of time. To this end, measurement values for
selected design metrics obtained from previously developed,
successful designs are stored in a database. If a new or modified
design is to be evaluated, the same measurements are applied. Then,
the distribution of each design metric is compared to the
distribution of these metrics stored in the database.<p>

<b>Figure 31:&nbsp;Benchmarking</b><p>

As an example, Figure&nbsp;31 shows a (fictitious) distribution of the
number of operations invoked from within a class. The vertical axis
indicates, for each value on the horizontal axis (number of invoked
operations), the percentage of classes that have that particular
value. In the example, the distribution of the new classes follows
closely the distribution of the benchmark, except for values 7 and 8,
which occur more frequently. Such deviations from expected
distributions pinpoint potential risk areas. These areas could then be
inspected to verify whether such a deviation is justified, or if a
redesign of that part should be considered.<p>

The example also illustrates why the examination of distributions
provides more information than simply defining thresholds for each
metric that are not to be exceeded. In the example, the number of
invoked operations is not exceedingly high for the candidate design -
the benchmark suggests 10 as an upper value. A simple threshold test
would have missed the potential design problem for the cluster of
classes with 7 and 8 operation calls.<p>
